As a filmmaker, I was happy to make the short "False and Baseless" with a strong emotional attachment. As a case manager, I want to share information that can empower individuals to help themselves. This site is for all viewers of the short to learn the resources for sexual assault survivors to use or even if someone knows anyone who needs it. 

I am providing links to organizations that provide counseling, legal aid, or assistance. Plus, this site mentions how to make a change in our communities to prevent rape or sexual assault. It is an unfortunate crime that happens to all types of people from different races, orientations, social classes, and genders. We should make a top priority to help survivors overcome trauma, and rid of our communities thE "rape's culture".
